Overview (Assignment Feature):

Professor view:


In the Assignment feature, there are two possibilities - either from professor side or student side. 

From professor point of view, they can create, update and delete the assignment but while doing the assignment they need to put some important information like "Assignment Deadline", "Description" and "Actual File Upload" and many more fields to come in Final Website.

Once all the assignment created, professor can see the list of assignments that are created. 

Student View:

Students can see the assignments with the same details that professor has given like final submission deadline, description and the either .pdf or .doc file in actual website (as of now students only can see the title of the assignment) and when the student click on the assingment - they can upload the file with the final work that they have done. 

Moreover, on the history button clicking, students can see their past submitted assignments links. As well as the students can confirm their assignment's status as well - either it is completed or in comeplete.
