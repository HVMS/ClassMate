Project Overview:

The classmate application provides a digital platform for students, professors, and campus administrators to efficiently manage and interact within an educational setting. It aims to streamline administrative tasks, facilitate effective communication between students and professors, and enhance the overall learning experience.

Overview (Assignment Feature):

Professor view:

Here is the workflow of my application as of now. It will improve in future definitely.

1. First page shows always two buttons - professor and student
2. By clicking on professor page - it will show me the assignment list only in view mode (Read only mode) and one navigation bar which asks for creating an assignment. 
3. Clicking on Create Assingment Button - it will ask to upload a file and important description and deadline with the Validations as well.
4. As of now it will not show the updated list of assignments in viewing the assignment to the professor.

Student View:

1. On Student side, students will see the first list of assignments in a tabular format with important information.
2. On Clicking Assignment item in a particular row
    a. it will ask a student to upload a comments box + file upload section where they can upload a file.
    b. That is entirely comes with validations part.
3. There is also a navigation bar - having one text and one button - History.
4. On Clicking History button it will redirect me to another page showing history of assignments.
